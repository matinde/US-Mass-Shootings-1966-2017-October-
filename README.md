# US-Mass-Shootings-1966-2017-October

Another Kaggle inspired data set looking at the US Shootings from 1966 to 2017. The analysis is not perfect and need to practice in removing NaNs and also remember to remove duplicate entries which were many in this dataset. 

I also need to know how to work with Str manipulations to identify columns or even combine columns. 

Plotting through Pandas and Matplotlib.pyplot is proving to be a bit hard. I will have to work on this as we go by. 

Just another simple Panda's practice.
